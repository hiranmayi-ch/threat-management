#  Malware Analysis Platform

This web-based platform is designed to facilitate ** malware analysis** through the input of URLs or hash values. It allows users to input suspicious URLs or file hashes and provides a safe and efficient method for detecting potential malware threats without executing the files. By leveraging a combination of hash-based checks and heuristic analysis, the platform uncovers potential malicious behaviors associated with the input data.

## Features
**Hash-based Detection:** The platform checks for known malware by analyzing provided hashes.
 
**Heuristic Analysis:** Detects suspicious patterns in the file or URL that may indicate malware.
 
**File Metadata Examination:** Extracts and analyzes file metadata for unusual properties.
 
**Embedded URL/IP Extraction:** Identifies and extracts any embedded URLs or IP addresses in the analyzed file.
 
**File Dependencies Analysis:** Reviews file dependencies to spot abnormal or dangerous relationships.
 
**Suspicious Patterns Detection:** Identifies common malware traits like obfuscation or unusual behaviors.
 
**Intuitive Dashboard:** Provides a user-friendly interface with detailed insights and results about the potential risks of a given URL or hash.

## How It Works

1. **Input:**
Users can either upload a file or input a URL/hash into the platform.

2. **Analysis:**
The platform performs static analysis on the provided input, examining various aspects.
 
3. **Output:**
Results are presented in a user-friendly dashboard that provides insights into the potential risks and characteristics of the input.

## Use Cases

**Malware Detection:**
Quickly identify malware using hash values or suspicious URLs.

**Cybersecurity Research:**
Use the platform to investigate malware samples and their behaviors.
