#  Malware Analysis Platform

This web-based platform is designed to facilitate **malware analysis** through the input of URLs or hash values. The tool enables users to upload or enter suspicious URLs or file hashes, which are then analyzed to uncover potential malicious behaviors associated with the given input. By leveraging a combination of hash-based checks and heuristic analysis, the platform identifies known malware samples and analyzes their structural properties without executing them, ensuring a safe and efficient method of detection.

The tool performs various static analysis techniques, including examining file metadata, extracting embedded URLs or IPs, analyzing file dependencies, and detecting suspicious patterns that may indicate malware. Results from the analysis are presented in an intuitive dashboard, offering users detailed insights into the characteristics and potential risks associated with the given URLs or hashes. This approach allows for quick identification of threats and serves as an effective first layer of defense against malware.

This repository is aimed at cybersecurity professionals, researchers, and developers who seek to improve their malware detection capabilities. It offers a user-friendly interface for rapid identification of potential threats, contributing to more robust and proactive cybersecurity practices.


## Features
**Hash-based Detection:** The platform checks for known malware by analyzing provided hashes.
 
**Heuristic Analysis:** Detects suspicious patterns in the file or URL that may indicate malware.
 
**File Metadata Examination:** Extracts and analyzes file metadata for unusual properties.
 
**Embedded URL/IP Extraction:** Identifies and extracts any embedded URLs or IP addresses in the analyzed file.
 
**File Dependencies Analysis:** Reviews file dependencies to spot abnormal or dangerous relationships.
 
**Suspicious Patterns Detection:** Identifies common malware traits like obfuscation or unusual behaviors.
 
**Intuitive Dashboard:** Provides a user-friendly interface with detailed insights and results about the potential risks of a given URL or hash.

## How It Works

1. **Input:**
Users can either upload a file or input a URL/hash into the platform.

2. **Analysis:**
The platform performs static analysis on the provided input, examining various aspects.
 
3. **Output:**
Results are presented in a user-friendly dashboard that provides insights into the potential risks and characteristics of the input.

## Use Cases

**Malware Detection:**
Quickly identify malware using hash values or suspicious URLs.

**Cybersecurity Research:**
Use the platform to investigate malware samples and their behaviors.
